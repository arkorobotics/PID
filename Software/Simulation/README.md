# PID Simulator

In this iPython notebook, we explore PID tuning methods by modeling a system and applying a PID controller with variable gains. Using the provided methods, students will learn to tune the system response and stability.

## Installation

You will need to install [iPython](http://ipython.org/) and few libraries:

```
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install scipy
pip3 install matplotlib

pip3 install control
```
