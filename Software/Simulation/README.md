# PID Simulator

In this iPython notebook, we explore PID controllers and gain tuning methods. 

We first start by modeling our system, then by applying PID controllers to compensate for error. Using the tuning methods provided in our documentation, students will learn how to tune the PID gain values to optimize for rise time, overshoot, settle time, steady-state error, and stability.

## Installation

You will need to install [iPython](http://ipython.org/) and few libraries:

```
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install scipy
pip3 install matplotlib

pip3 install control
```
