# PID

This project is intended for teaching the general public about PID controllers and gain tuning methods.

In order to better understand PID, users are encouraged to build a simple electromechanical system consisting of a motor, a motor driver, an encoder, and a microcontroller. The system is then put out of balanced by mounting a metal bar at the end of the motors output shaft, making it difficult for the motor to maintain a constant position or velocity. 

This is where PID controllers come into play. Using the code provided in this repository, users can implement a PID controller in software, and easily tune the gain values of the controller to stabilize the system such that it maintains a desired position or velocity.


In this repository you will find the necessary hardware, software, and schematics to build this system.
