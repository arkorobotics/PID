# PID

This respository is intended for teaching the general public about PID controllers and gain tuning methods.

To better understand PID, we build a simple mechanical system using a stick mounted to the output shaft of a motor. This stick serves as disurbance to our motors output shaft. By using an encoder, motor driver, and an Arduino Uno, students are able drive the motor as well as measure the position and/or velocity of the output shaft. From there, students are then able implement a PID controller to stabilze position and/or velocity of the output shaft.
